"""In this code, we first load the database into a Pandas DataFrame data. We define the fitness function fitness, which returns the sum of the Cardiff Ladder Scale and GDP columns for a given solution x.

Next, we define the ABC algorithm ABC, which takes in the database, the colony size, the number of iterations, and a limit array to keep track of the number of iterations since a solution was last improved by a scout bee. We initialize the population by randomly selecting colony_size solutions from the database, and then we start the iterations.

In the employed bees phase, we randomly select a solution and a neighbor, and generate a new solution by adding a random perturbation 
In general, the selection of a fitness function depends on the problem at hand and the specific goals of the optimization process.

In the case of the example code provided, the fitness function used aims to minimize the absolute difference between the predicted values (i.e., obtained by the ABC algorithm) and the actual values of the Cardif ladder scale and GDP columns in the input data. This is a common approach when dealing with regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous variable. The absolute difference is used instead of the squared difference (MSE) because it is more robust to outliers in the data. However, this choice may not be optimal for all datasets and objectives, and different fitness functions may be more appropriate.
